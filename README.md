# 📊 Power BI Historic Report

This project presents an in-depth analysis of the growth, performance, and financial health of an Australian-based security company from 2019 to 2024. Using **Power BI** and **Excel**, I created an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of the company's key metrics, aimed at internal stakeholders and potential investors.

## 📅 Project Overview
The dashboard focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) and data visualizations to show how the company has evolved over the past five years. The insights help assess the company’s strengths and demonstrate its value to potential clients. The report includes:

- **Summary**: Financial growth, active employees, active clients, retention rates, and branch distribution in Australia and New Zealand.
- **Client Overview**: Number of clients, revenue per client, retention rates, geographic distribution, and most valuable client.
- **Sales Analysis**: Top products/services, sales by region, total sales by year and month, sales per customer type (B2B or B2C).
- **Financial Overview**: Net income, EBITDA, profit margins, income and expenses breakdown by year and month.

## 🔧 Tools Used
